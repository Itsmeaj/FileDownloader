Non-Automatable Test Scenarios

1. Network Issues or API Rate Limits:

Description: Test how the script behaves under network instability or Google Drive API rate limits.
Manual Test: Simulate network issues using tools like tc in Linux or deliberately exhaust API limits.
Expected Result: The script should either retry the connection or fail gracefully with a clear error message.

2. Large File Downloads:
Description: Test the script's ability to handle very large files, which may cause timeouts or memory issues.
Manual Test: Attempt to download a large file (e.g., > 1GB).
Expected Result: The file should download successfully, or the script should provide feedback on issues like timeouts.

3. Google Drive Permissions:
Description: Test how the script reacts when the Google Drive file is not shared with the user (insufficient permissions).
Manual Test: Attempt to download a file without sharing it with the service account.
Expected Result: The script should fail with an appropriate error message indicating permission issues.
